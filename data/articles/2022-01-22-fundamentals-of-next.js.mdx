[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework built on top of the React.js library and provides the best development experience with a host of features like [SSR and SSG](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching), [Image optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization), [support for TypeScript](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/typescript), [i18n](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing) and many more.

Learn more about the fundamentals o Next.js as we disect the features offered by the framework.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

**[Static Site Generation
(SSG)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props)**
is useful when you want to generate the HTML when the site builds. This can
increase the build time but ensures that no data fetching happens when a page
loads.

<Callout type="info">
  Use SSG when the content of your site doesn't change that often. [The
  blog](https://github.com/ghoshnirmalya/nirmalyaghosh.com) that your viewing
  right now uses SSG to generate all the pages during build time. When this site
  is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com), all the pages of this site gets
  generated.
</Callout>

Play with the component below to visually understand how SSG works in a Next.js application.

## Server-side Rendering (SSR)

**[Server-side Rendering
(SSR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)**
is useful when you want to generate the HTML on every request.

<Callout type="info">
  Use SSR when the content of your site changes frequently based on the user. If
  the pages of your site requires authentication or authorization. you can use
  SSR. In SSR, the HTML of a page is generated per request.
</Callout>

Play with the component below to visually understand how SSG works in a Next.js application.

## Data Fetching

Next.js provides several methods for data fetching such as [getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props), [getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props) and [getInitialProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-initial-props). These methods allow you to fetch data for your page and make it available for the page to render.

- **[getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props)** is used to fetch the data at build time, which is useful for static websites.

- **[getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)** is used to fetch the data on each request, which is useful for dynamic websites.

- **[getInitialProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-initial-props)** is a legacy method that is used to fetch the data on the server and pass it to the client.

Each of these data fetching methods can be used to fetch data for your page and make it available for the page to render. For example, you can use **[getStaticProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props)** to fetch the data at build time for a static website, or use **[getServerSideProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)** to fetch the data on each request for a dynamic website. Additionally, **[getInitialProps](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-initial-props)** is a legacy method that can be used to fetch the data on the server and pass it to the client.

Once data has been fetched, it can be used to render the page. For example, you can use the data to display a list of items on your page, or to create a form. Additionally, Next.js provides several tools that can be used to simplify the process of data fetching, such as the [swr](https://swr.now.sh/) library. With these tools, you can easily fetch data and use it to render your page.
